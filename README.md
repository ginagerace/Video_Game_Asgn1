I used a map of the United States as the floor of my game to address the "What home means to you" theme. I have targets on several different states in the midwest area of different sizes and point values. The target on Illinois is worth the most points and the other states have lesser point values, decreasing more the farther they are from Illinois.

I used textures found on the Unity Asset Store, as well as a map of the US I got off Google. All the scripts used were from the tutorial given in class.
